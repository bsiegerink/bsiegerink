- 👋 Hi, I’m @bsiegerink
- 👀 I’m interested in how we can improve the way we do and organize research. This means I am working on both the policy and (meta-)research focussed on the Quality and Integrity of Science. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work more reproducible, including working with Git / GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research on researchers.
